Abstraction:

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
Abstraction is used when we want to show the essential things to the user and hides the internal details.

Ways to achieve Abstraction
There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java

Abstract class (0 to 100%)
Interface (100%)

for example, sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.

Abstract class in Java:
A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.

Points to Remember
An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
It cannot be instantiated.
It can have constructors and static methods also.
It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body

note:
Rule: If there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.
