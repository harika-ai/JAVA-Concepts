Serialisation:  Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. 

Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object.

Explaination:
After usage of the object, Garbage collector will automatically destroy the object within JVM.
If  we want to reuse the same object within same JVM or in anther JVM we need to save it. For security purpose the object is converted into bytestream by using Serialisation.
This byte stream is saved in local files.
While reusing the object using deserialisation again converting into object from byte stream.

Note: Serialisable which is a marker interface in java.
There is no method implementation or method body thats why called as marker interface 
Ex: Serialisable, Clonable,Comparable
