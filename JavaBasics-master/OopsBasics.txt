Object class:

The Object class is the parent class of all the classes in java by default. 

Object obj=getObject();//we don't know what object will be returned from this method  

Object cloning:

The object cloning is a way to create exact copy of an object. The clone() method of Object class is used to clone an object.

The java.lang.Cloneable interface must be implemented by the class whose object clone we want to create. If we don't implement Cloneable interface, clone() method generates CloneNotSupportedException.

The clone() method is defined in the Object class. Syntax of the clone() method is as follows:

protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException.

The clone() method saves the extra processing task for creating the exact copy of an object. If we perform it by using the new keyword, it will take a lot of processing time to be performed that is why we use object cloning.
