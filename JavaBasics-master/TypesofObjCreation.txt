Different ways to create an Object in Java:

Class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. Different ways are :

* Use new keyword
* Using "newInstance()" method of a class
* Using "newInstance()" method of constructor
* Using Object Deserialisation
* Using Object cloning - clone() method.


* Use new keyword:
From this we create object as below
                ClassName Obj = new ClassName(); --- Default Constructor
		ClassName Obj = new ClassName(Parameters); --- Parameterized Constructor


* Using "newInstance()" method of a class:
String packageName = "fully qualified PackageName" ;
Class classObj = Class.forName(packageName);
Note:  forName-: It is a static method used for loading class from fully qualified PackageName
Student object = (Student)classObj.newInstance();


* Using "newInstance()" method of constructor:
			Constructor<ClassName> constructor;
			constructor = ClassName.class.getConstructor();

Note: We should import "java.lang.reflect.Constructor " package
Getting runtime exception in eclipse while executing example.Need to look once.

* Using Object Deserialisation :

------------------------------------------------------------------------
	refer Program in Eclipse and serialisatin concept in notepad.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


* Using Object cloning - clone() method :

Clone method is used to create a copy of an existing object.
In order to use the clone() method the corresponding class should have implemented a cloneable interface.
Again it is a marker interface.
