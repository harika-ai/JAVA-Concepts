Creation of our own immutable class:

Note: Immutable class wont change the content of existing object. If we need to reuse that existing object with the same content then we use the immutable class
If the content is changed by passing the literals then immutable class creates new object. 


Final vs Immutability:

Final is applicable for variable i.e, final variable.
Final is not applicable for object. Immutable is applicable for object.
Immutable is not applicable for variable.

In final, reinitialisation is not possible i.e, replacement of the total content is not possible by using final.
But by using final,the content of the object will be changed by  using concatenation.
