Encapsulation:

Protecting data members and providing access to the data members throgh member functions i.e, getters and setter methods is called encapsulation.

In order to encapsulate a program variables must be declared as private but methods should be public.

If a program is not encapsulated data members will be under user's control. In such case user may misuse the data members by assigning invalid data values.

But, If a program is encapsulated then data members will be under the developer control.In such cases developer deciides which value is valid or invalid and which value to allow or not allowed.

By using encapsulation as a basis, we can achieve "javabean" class.

JavaBean class : Developing a class, where each data members will have a sepertae getters and setter methods, this type of classes are called javabean classes.

JavaBean classes are used for developing "Enterprise Javabean(EJB)" applications.

Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
