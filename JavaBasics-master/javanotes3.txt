Multiple classes are possible in Java .
But during compilation and execution there is no rule that class name is same as file name.
we can give any new name also as a java file name.
After compilation .java file is converted as byte code.
this is stored in based on number of classes present in java file as number of class files.
Note: java file name can be anything but class file name must be same as class name.
