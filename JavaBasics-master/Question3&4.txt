Importance of string constant pool area:

If any repeating object value for more than one object then no need to create multiple objects.

scp is there for only storing unique literals. we cannot perform any operation in scp(Ex: concat)

So from above for storing unique literals for different objects we use scp

If one object want to change its value then all dependent objectsgoing to effect.

To overcome this we use immutability nature of string.

why scp concept is available only for string object not for string buffer?

* Because string is immutable for that we need scp to store unique literals for multiple objects which we dont want to change later.
 where as string buffer is mutable for this there is no need of scp. why because each individual object may have same or different values.

*string objects are immutable where as string buffer objects are mutable.

Note: All wrapper class objects are immutable we can use same data for several objects upto some instant.
