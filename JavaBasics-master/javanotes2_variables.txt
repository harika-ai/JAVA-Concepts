Note : Every obj will have connection with stack pool area.
	Non static will present in object and all static members are present in stack pool area thatis why obj will have connection with stack pool area.

Note: During re initialisation of static variables into the static method no need of usage of static key word but for non static variables, while reinitialising we should create an obj 


Note:
Static variables are called class variables, if we change the value of sv in any method the value will be changed in entire class because we have only 1 copy of static variable.
